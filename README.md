<b>What is this website for?</b>
-   This is website is to provide users with a functional and simplistic game that provides entertainment. It randomly generats cards, and requires the user to click them to find matches. There's a total of 10 possible matches.


<b>Why did you create this project?</b>
-   I created this project to replicate a game me and my mother played when I was younger. The initial game was recalled, so I thought to make my own version that others can enjoy the same way I did when I was younger.
   

<b>What did you use to create this project?</b>
-   I used HTML for the structure of the website, CSS for the styling and aesthetics of the website, and I used JavaScript to implement the game functionality and keep score. Also, I used viewport values to help with the responsiveness of the site without implementing media queries. This project also uses JavaScript's built-in audio API.
   

<b>How to run this application?</b>
-   You can begin playing this game by clicking the green 'Start' button on the bottom part of the page. The bar on the left-hand side will fill as time runs out. Game will be over when times runs out or you find all possible matches which is a total of 10.
